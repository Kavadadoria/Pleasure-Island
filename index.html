          <h2>Welcome to Pleasure Island, North Carolina!</h2>

          <p>
            Pleasure Island is a coastal barrier island off the coast of
            Southeastern North Carolina,south of Wilmington located in New Hanover County's Federal Point Township.</p><p>
            The island is home to the coastal tourist towns of: Carolina Beach
            and Kure Beach, as well as the annexed settlements of Wilmington
            Beach and Han by Beach.</p><p> Corncake Inlet (New Inlet) separated the
            southern end of Pleasure Island from Bald Head Island (Smith Island)
            until Hurricane Bonnie shoaled and closed the inlet in 1998, making
            Pleasure Island and Bald Head Island no longer independent islands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carolina Beach Inlet is now in the north, the Cape Fear River is in
            the west, Atlantic Ocean is in the east, and Long Bay (Atlantic
            Ocean) is in the south. It is 17 miles long, with a width of 2 miles
            in the far north, 3 miles in the far south, and around 12 miles in
            the middle. "The point," or headland, known as Cape Fear, is located
            on the southeastern tip of the merged island. The Frying Pan Shoals,
            which jut 30 miles into the Atlantic Ocean southeast of the point,
            are shallow and dangerous. The shoal (or sandbar) is formed by the
            meeting of Atlantic Ocean Bay and Long Bay longshore currents, as
            well as the discharge from the Cape Fear River.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pleasure Island refers to the merged island's northern half, while
            Bald Head Island refers to the combined island's southern half.
            Pleasure Island's northern border is formed by Snows Cut. Only at
            low tide is the rock pile in the foreground visible. Prior to the
            building of Snows Cut, a man-made canal in 1931, the area that
            currently makes up Pleasure Island was part of a peninsula known as
            Federal Point, which spanned from Myrtle Grove to Fort Fisher. At
            the southern end of the peninsula, on the outskirts of New Inlet,
            the Federal Point Light previously existed.

            The "island" began as the lower tip of the Federal Point Peninsula,
            which was originally confined in the south by the New Inlet break in
            the barrier islands. This inlet was "new" since it was formed by a
            huge storm in September of 1761. New Inlet was really the preferred
            entrance to the Cape Fear River for ships going for Wilmington for
            decades afterward, since it provided a deeper, shorter, and less
            perilous path than the Bald Head/Old Inlet Channel at the Cape
            Fear's mouth. Blockade runners used the New Inlet route frequently
            during the Civil War, which led to the construction of Confederate
            Fort Fisher at this location.
